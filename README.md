# SortingApp-New

This app is a user interface application built using Kotlin. It allows users to test different sorting algorithms on randomly generested sets of integers that appear in a side bar on the menu. The application supports many sorting algorithms such as `bubble sort`, `merge sort`, `selection sort`

# Features

`Random Lists`: Users are able to specify the number of integers they wish to see randomly
`Sorting Algorithms`: Users can also specify the sorting algorithms they wish to see used on the data
`Results`: They are also able to view the `sorted` and `unsorted` lists side by side
